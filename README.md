### Session Outline

- Course overview and expectations

- Initialize your personal project repository for the semester

### Group Activity

- Draft an initial research question (e.g., sentiment over chapters, topic trends, stylistic fingerprinting)

### Homework

- Short reflection: why this author/text? what you plan to measure

- Complete repo setup and make your first commit (README + checklist)

### Key Takeaways

- Texts can be profiled with simple, reproducible metrics

- Historical ideas (frequency analysis) connect directly to modern NLP (information theory)

- A clear author choice and research question will guide all subsequent sessions
